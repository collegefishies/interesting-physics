\subsection{Does it sink or float?}
	Imagine a sea of superfluid\footnote{Note that this implies the existence of 
	a gravitational field, which in our case is uniform.} with density $\rho$,
	 and a bullet with density $\rho$ so that at rest the bullet can remain 
	suspended in the ocean without floating or sinking. Next consider the same 
	bullet shot through that very ocean with speed $v$ along the horizontal.

	From the ocean's point of view, the bullet will contract and therefore 
	become more dense, and thus it will sink. While in the frame of the bullet, 
	the ocean becomes more dense and thus the bullet should float. How do we
	resolve this paradox?\\
