There are two main ways of going about this problem, one is to assume the ball to be rigid and the other as composed of atoms. If we suppose it to be rigid, it becomes an exercise in understanding forces and torques, if we look at it from the perspective that it is made from atoms, and thus deformable, that the situation becomes a bit more complicated.

In the rigid body view, let's consider the ball to be in space free of any forces, and away from the floor.
